# Numworks-Physics-Engine

> **Note**
> This program requires additional python modules provided by changing your Numworks calculator firmware to [Omega](https://getomega.dev/) or [Upsilon](https://getupsilon.web.app/)

> **Note**
> Due to the technical limitations of the calculator, the program becomes laggy after about ten particles in the simulation.
